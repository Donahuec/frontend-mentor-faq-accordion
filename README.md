## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup -> details and summary components
- CSS custom properties
- WAAPI - Web Animation API

### What I learned

- Effectively use the details and summary html elements to create semantic html accordion, and the web animation api to animate it

### Useful resources

- [How to Animate the Details Element Using WAAPI](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-animate-the-details-element-using-waapi/) - Explained how to animate details components, allowing us to use the semantic html for our component, even though it does not natively support animations via css
